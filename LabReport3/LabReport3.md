Part 1 - Bugs
Choose one of the bugs from week 4’s lab.

Provide:

- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
- An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
- The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
- Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.

**Part 1 - Bugs**
When testing with JUnit, the program would not properly reverse the elements of the list in both the `reversed` and `reversedInPlace` methods. For this example, I'll refer to the `reversedInPlace` method. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program from week 4's lab was as simple as a regular list such as `{1, 2, 3}`. The code for the `reversedInPlace` method prior to fixing and my test follows:  
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }

@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace3Items() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3, 2, 1}, input1);
}
```
This resulted in an incorrectly ordered list error where the last element was '3' when it should've been '1'.
